        <span>Another famous dish is <b>tagine</b> which is highly perfected in the way it's served. Tagine is a traditional stew made with either lamb or chicken meat, topped with veggies and is eaten with bread, no utensils! Tagine is served in a cone shaped ceramic pot.</span>,
        <span>Fun fact: another side dish Moroccans enjoy is cooked snails! (they're actually very yummy)
