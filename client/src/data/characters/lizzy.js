        <span>My momâ€™s favorite sport was badminton. It is like tennis but the racquet is smaller and they are hitting something called a shuttle instead of a ball.</span>],

It's also called the Lunar New Year, because the dates of the holiday follow the moon phases. We celebrate with red decorations, bright lanterns, fireworks, and a festival! Families eat yummy foods like dumplings, and exchange gifts such as red envelopes with money.</span>],
